notes:

the priority:

- integrating data from services, displayed in a non-horrible way
- being able to dynamically add new service calls to the page, from the interface
- caching the data
- integrating the data with search, semweb, etc.
- different types of outputs and views


so, for #1:
- pick a layout framework that lets you JGID, so you can move on to the integration framework
- keep the layout stuff in the views, so you can change it later. no big whoop.
- need a framework that lets you:
-- add sections and sub-sections
-- editable forms that look good
-- drop-down menus and other types of menus.
-- use of icons

give dijit a shot.
